## Algorithm visualization with Flutter & Dart 

This project aims to visualize different algorithms using Flutter in & Dart. Starting from path finding algorithms, but wishing to go further to arrays, trees, graphs... 

Feel free to contribute by opening some PR's :fire:

# Ideas :sparkles:

-  Add time control, to increase/decrease time step
-  Enable/disable diagonal nodes
-  Ability to move the end/start node and see the change
-  Impmenent sorting of nodes with heap rather then sorting a list for Dijkstra/A*
-  Swarm algorithms
-  Other algorithms for pathfinding 
-  Other algorithms in general, like sorting, searching, trees, graphs
